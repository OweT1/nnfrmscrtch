# Neural Network from Scratch

The project is a simple one; Creating a Neural Network from Scratch. We are simply going to create a Neural Network to train on the famous MINST dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/).

We are restricted to foundation python packages; mainly `math`, `numpy`, `pandas` and also `kaggle` (to download the data from Kaggle using their API).

## Downloading of Data

To download the data, you can either download the data from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/), or you may run the script provided at:

```bash
scripts/download_data.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> In order to run the scripts, you need to set up your Kaggle credentials.
> Instructions for setting up can be found here: https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api/blob/main/docs/README.md

## Running of Neural Network

The sample Neural Network can be found in `src/notebooks/mnist_nn.ipynb`. You can do your own experimentations and runs there.
